# asus_managed_router
These scripts were not designed for production. They serve a temporary and specific purpose, which is to get MAC address info from ASUS AC66U routers and put them into a field in a specific object in Salesforce. 
One could use sections of this code for other purposes, or pick parts of it for examples of how to talk to an ASUS router by SSH and run commands programatically, or how to upload information to Salesforce.

I make no guarantees as to quality or security. Use at your own risk.
